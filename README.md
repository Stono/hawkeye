Hawkeye is a project security, vulnerability and general risk highlighting tool.  It has a few goals:

  - Designed to be entirely extensible by just adding new modules with the correct signature to [lib/modules](lib/modules)
  - Modules return results via a common interface, which permits consolidated reporting and artefact generation
  - Should be very easy to run regardless of the type of project that you're scanning

## Looking for support
Hi!  I don't have time to support hawkeye moving forward, so I am actively looking for maintainers.  I you've got an interest in this project and fancy helping out - please reach out to me!

## Important Notes (please read)
 - As of version `1.0.0` many of the modules have had their identifiers changed and prefixed for langues added to them, for example `npmaudit` is now `node-npmaudit`.  This means you will need to udpate your `.hawkeyerc` files, and any commands where you explicitly specify modules eg `hawkeye scan -m thing`.

## Modules
Modules are basically little bits of code that either implement their own logic, or wrap a third party tool and standardise the output.  They only run if the required criteria are met, for example; the `npm outdated` module would only run if a `package.json` is detected in the scan target - as a result, you don't need to tell Hawkeye what type of project you are scanning.  The modules implemented so far are:

### Generic Modules:
 - __File Names (files)__: Scan the file list recursively, looking for patterns as defined in [data.js](lib/modules/files/data.js), taken from [gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob).  We're looking for things like `id_rsa`, things that end in `pem`, etc.
 - __File Content Patterns (contents)__: Looks for patterns as defined in [data.js](lib/modules/content/data.js) within the contents of files, things like 'password: ', and 'BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY' will pop up here.
 - __File Content Entropy (entropy)__:  Scan files for strings with high (Shannon) entropy, which could indicate passwords or secrets stored in the files, for example: 'kwaKM@Â£rFKAM3(a2klma2d'
 - __Credit Card Numbers (ccnumber)__:  Scan for credit card numbers in files, validated using [luhn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).

### Node JS:
 - __NPM audit (node-npmaudit)__: Wraps [npm audit](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/audit) to check your package.json and package-lock.json for known vulnerabilities.
 - __NPM outdated (node-npmoutdated)__: Wraps [npm outdated](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/outdated) to check your package.json for outdated modules.
 - __CrossEnv (node-crossenv)__: See [Node Cross-Env Malware](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/163723642530/crossenv-malware-on-the-npm-registry).  Checks your package.json for known malicious modules which contain this malware.
 - __Constant Hash Tables (node-chs)__: See [Node Constant Hashtable](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/july-2017-security-releases).  Checks if your package.json can be run against vulnerable versions of node.

### Ruby:
 - __Bundler Audit (ruby-bundler-scan)__: Wraps [Bundler Audit](https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit) to check your Gemfile/Gemfile.lock for known vulnerabilities.
 - __Brakeman (ruby-brakeman)__: Wraps [Brakeman](https://brakemanscanner.org) for static analysis security vulnerability scanner for Ruby on Rails applications.

### Python:
 - __Safety (python-safety)__: Wraps [Safety](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) to check your requirements.txt for known vulnerabilities. Unfortunately, safety does not provides a risk level classification of the vulneravilities, so every vulnerability is logged as high.
 - __Piprot (python-piprot)__: Wraps [Piprot](https://github.com/sesh/piprot) to check your requirements.txt for outdated dependencies.
  - __Bandit (python-bandit)__: Wraps [Bandit](https://github.com/openstack/bandit) to find common security issues in python code.

### Java:
 - __FindSecBugs (java-find-secbugs)__: Wraps [FindSecBugs](https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/) to find common security issues in Java Projects. It analyzes the jar generated after performing `mvn package` or `gradle stage`.
 - __OWASP Dependency Check (java-owasp)__: Wraps [OWASP Dep Check](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Dependency_Check) to find common security issues in Java Project Dependencies as noted by the National Vulnerability Database. It analyzes the jar generated after performing `mvn package` or `gradle stage`.

### PHP:
 - __security-checker (php-security-checker)__: Wraps [security-checker](https://github.com/sensiolabs/security-checker) to check your composer.lock for known vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities are logged as high due to a lack of classification.

I really, really do welcome people writing new modules so please check out [lib/modules/example-shell/index.js](lib/modules/example-shell/index.js) as an example of how simple it is, and send me a pull request.

### Current Limitations
 - Entropy is disabled by default because it can return a lot of results, which are mostly misses, to run it please use the `-m entropy` switch.  Personally I use this manually checking over code bases I have inherited.
 - We only look inside the contents of files up to 1Mb, I plan to add configuration options in the future to allow you to change this.

## Running Hawkeye
I wanted Hawkeye to be as flexible as possible, as a result it supports numerous methods of execution.

### Standalone (command line)
#### Using Docker (recommended)
As Hawkeye wraps a lot of other dependencies, the easiest way to run it is using docker.  Simply type `docker run --rm -v $PWD:/target stono/hawkeye`.

#### Using docker-compose
Lets say you have project which has a `Dockerfile`, with lines like this in:

```
COPY . /app
VOLUME /app
```

You could add hawkeye to your compose file like this:

```
services:
  app:
    build: .

  hawkeye:
    image: stono/hawkeye
    command: scan -t /app
    volumes_from:
      - app
```

You can simply do `docker-compose run --rm --no-deps hawkeye`.  Woo hoo.

#### Using NPM
If you want, you can do `npm install -g hawkeye-scanner`, and type `hawkeye scan` instead.  However, this will require you to have all of the other dependencies installed on your host for the modules that you're wanting to scan with.

### As part of your CI Pipelines
#### GoCD
This is an example of running Hawkeye against one of your projects in GoCD:

```
<pipeline name="security-scan">
  <stage name="Hawkeye" cleanWorkingDir="true">
    <jobs>
      <job name="scan">
        <tasks>
          <exec command="docker">
            <arg>pull</arg>
            <arg>stono/hawkeye</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
          <exec command="bash">
            <arg>-c</arg>
            <arg>docker run --rm -v $PWD:/target stono/hawkeye</arg>
            <runif status="passed" />
          </exec>
        </tasks>
      </job>
    </jobs>
  </stage>
</pipeline>
```

### As a git pre-commit hook
This is an example of running Hawkeye from an npm package.json against a local repository before commit, failing the commit if high or critical issues are found:

```
{
  "name": "demoproj",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "demo",
  "main": "app.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.16.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "pre-commit": "^1.2.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "hawkeye:pre-commit": "hawkeye scan -t ./src -m contents -m files -f high"
  },
  "pre-commit": [
    "hawkeye:pre-commit"
  ],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

## Easy Configuration
As of version `0.9.0`, you can use the familiar `.hawkeyerc` and `.hawkeyeignore` pattern in your project root.

### .hawkeyerc
This file takes all the same options as `hawkeye scan --help`.   In this example, we'll run the `contents`, `entropy`, `files`, `npm outdated` and `npm audit`
```
{
  "modules": ["contents", "entropy", "files", "node-npmoutdated", "node-npmaudit"],
  "failOn": "medium"
}
```

### .hawkeyeignore
This file should be a collection of patterns to exclude from the scan, and is equivalent to running `--exclude`.
```
^test/
README.md
```

## The CLI
### `hawkeye scan`
There are a few options available:

#### -a, --all: Running against all files rather than git tree
Hawkeye by default will attempt to detect a .git folder in your target, if it is there it will only scan git tracked files.  Further to that, if a .git-crypt folder is detected, we will also exclude files which are GPG encrypted.  If there is no .git in the target directory, then all files will be scanned.

You can override this behaviour with the `--all` flag, which will scan all files regardless.

#### -f, --fail-on <low, medium, high, critical>: When to exit with a non-zero status code
From a pipeline perspective, the `--fail-on` command is useful, you might not wish for `low` items to break your build, so you could use `--fail-on medium`.

#### -t, --target  </path/to/project>: Specfiy what to scan
By default Hawkeye will look in your current working directory.  You can override this behaviour though by specifying a `--target`

#### -m, --module  <module name>: Running only specific modules
If you want to run specific modules only, you can use the `--module` flag, which can be specified multiple times.  For example `hawkeye scan -m node-npmaudit -m node-npmoutdated` would run just the `npm audit` and `npm outdated` modules.

#### -j, --json    </path/to/summary.json>: Produce a JSON artefact
The `--json` paramter allows you to write a much more detailed report to a file. See the Json section below for more information

#### -s, --sumologic    <http://sumologic-http-collector>: Send the results to SumoLogic
This will post the results to a SumoLogic HTTP collector.  See the SumoLogic section below for more information.

#### -e, --exclude  <pattern>: Exclude files that match a specified RegEx pattern
This parameter (which can be specified multiple times) allows you to specify patterns you wish to be excluded from the scan.  For example `hawkeye scan -e "^test/"` would exclude all your test files.  All paths are __relative__ to the `--target`.

There are some global exclusions in place, and those are "^.git", "^.git-crypt" and "^node_modules".

#### -l, --file-limit  <n>: Set limit on number of files to be scanned (Defaults to 1000)
The `--file-limit` allows you to set a higher file limit thab the default (1000). This is useful when the target directory includes more files.

### `hawkeye modules`
You can view the module status with `hawkeye modules`.  As previously mentioned you can see that entropy is disabled by default.  If you want to run it, use the `-m entropy` flag.

```

Here are some other handy examples:

- `(hawkeye scan >/dev/null) 2>&1 | tail -n +3 | grep critical` - output just critical items

Another option is for you to use a different output writer, for example...

### Json
You can output much more information in the form of a JSON artefact that groups by executed module.

Check out a sample [here](test/samples/results.json)

### SumoLogic
The output of Hawkeye can be sent to a SumoLogic HTTP collector of your choice.  In this example, I have a collector of `hawkeye`, with a single HTTP source.
```
hawkeye scan --sumo https://collectors.us2.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/your-http-collector-url

...
[info] Doing writer: sumologic
[info] sending 16 results to SumoLogic
```

And in sumo logic, search for `_collector="hawkeye" | json auto`:

![SumoLogic](screenshots/sumologic.png)

## Development

### Adding a new handler
The idea is that this project should be super extensible, I want people to write new handlers with ease.  Simply create a handler in `lib/modules` which exposes the following signature:

  - key: A short alphanumeric key for your module
  - name: The name of your module
  - description: The description of your module
  - enabled: True or Fale as to if this module should run by default, or if it needs to be specified with `--module`
  - function handles(path): A function to decide if this handler should run against the target path
  - function run(results, done): The function which is called if handles returns true

### The run function
The first argument passed is `results`, this is where the module should send its results to, it exposes four methods for each 'level' of issue found, `critical`, `high`, `medium` and `low`.  Those methods expect you to pass something like this:

```
results.critial('offender', 'description', 'extra', { additional: 'data' });
```
